Passive Sniffing

Passive sniffing attacks are performed by just “watching” packets on a network in order to gather sensitive information such as userids, passwords, and other sensitive information. They are difficult to be detected due to their “hands off” approach to gathering information. The only tool you need is a sniffer, such as Wireshark.

Active Sniffing

Active sniffing is performed by actively performing \(malicious\) operations \(MAC flooding or ARP poisoning\) on the network. This means that we will inject packets on the network in order to redirect the traffic.
