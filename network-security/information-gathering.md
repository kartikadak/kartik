# Information Gathering

The Information gathering phase is focused on two essential aspects of all targets: 

1. Business
2. Infrastructure.

The Business side of information gathering deals with collecting information regarding the type of business, its stakeholders, assets, products, services, employees and generally non-technical information.

 The organization will probably operate its business purpose through an Infrastructure such as networks, systems, domains, IP addresses and so on.

The information gathering can be classified in two main disciplines:

1. Passive
2. Active

Passive or OSINT \(Open Source INTelligence\) information gathering is gathering as much information about our target \(network, system...\) without exposing our presence. In this phase we not only try to gather information such as web presence, partners, financial info, and physical plants but also, infrastructure related information using publicly available resources \(accessible by anyone\).

Active information gathering techniques interact directly with the target system. In this phase, we will gather information about ports, services, running systems, net blocks and so on. In general, active techniques can reveal the investigation to the organization through IDS or servers logs so caution should be taken to prevent this.

Web Presence

In this phase, you will learn a great deal more about your target including:

* What they do
* What is their business purpose
* Physical and logical locations
* Employees and departments
* Email and contact information
* Alternative web sites and sub-domains
* Press releases, news, comments, opinions
